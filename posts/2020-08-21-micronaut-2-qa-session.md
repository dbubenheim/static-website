## OVERVIEW

Micronaut 2.0 was released on June 26, 2020 with a ton of exciting new features and improvements.

Whether you're new to Micronaut or you've been following the framework since it dramatically transformed the JVM landscape in 2017, you'll find much to celebrate in the latest iteration of the technology, including expanded native image support, more reactive library support modules, an improved threading model, and even more service deployment options.

On August 21, 2020, Micronaut co-founder, Jeff Scott Brown, and Product Development Lead, James Kleeh, hosted a relaxed, virtual Q&A session in which attendees become acquainted with all that Micronaut 2 has to offer and had an opportunity to learn first-hand how to make the most of the framework.
