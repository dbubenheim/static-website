One of the things that makes Micronaut an ideal framework for lightweight applications like microservices and serverless apps is the fact that ahead-of-time (AoT) compilation avoids runtime reflection. This allows Micronaut applications to start up really fast and consume very little memory.

In this webinar, Micronaut team member, [Iván López](https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team#lopez), demonstrates how IntelliJ IDEA can help developers improve their productivity when writing Micronaut applications.

Join Iván and host, JetBrains Developer Advocate, Mala Gupta, to learn a variety of helpful tips for effectively building Micronaut applications with different options and features directly from the IDE using IntelliJ IDEA.

Topics to be covered include:

- Configuration auto-completion
- Controller endpoints auto-discovery
- HTTP client

This webinar is presented in partnership with [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/).
