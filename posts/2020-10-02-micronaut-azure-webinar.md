Micronaut functions and Azure are a productive, end-to-end development experience: build, debug, deploy, and monitor functions seamlessly. 

Join Microsoft's [Julien Dubois](https://www.julien-dubois.com/bio.html) and 2GM (Groovy, Grails, and Micronaut) team member, [Sergio del Amo](https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team#caballero), for an introduction to the Azure functions programming model, a model based on triggers and bindings that assist with responding to events and seamlessly connecting to services.

Participants will gain a solid understanding of Azure functions and witness first-hand how and why they'll benefit from developing them with Micronaut.

Topics covered include:

- Azure Functions
    - Triggers
    - Hosting options
    - Common use cases
- Micronaut Azure Functions
    - Micronaut Azure HTTP Functions
- Functions Development
    - Build
    - Testing
    - Deployment
    - Monitoring

No particular expertise with Micronaut or Azure is required; however, you will benefit if you are already familiar with both technologies.
