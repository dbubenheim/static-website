When a millisecond delay can mean all the difference, the right tools are critical.

Join 2GM (Groovy, Grails, and Micronaut) team member, Álvaro Sánchez-Mariscal, and Amazon Software Development Manager, Azeem Jiva, for a live tutorial demonstrating the most effective ways to reduce latencies with Micronaut and Amazon Corretto. 

Topics covered include:

- Micronaut Overview
    - AWS
    - Lambda
    - JRE
- Corretto Overview
- Shenandoah
- Latencies
